# Reference Images

This directory contains the reference images for the digital menu app:

- `homeScreenGrid.jpeg` - Home screen in grid mode
- `homeScreenList.jpeg` - Home screen in list mode  
- `homeScreenNoVeg.jpeg` - Home screen showing non-veg filter active

## Note

These are placeholder references. In a real implementation, you would:

1. Replace these with actual screenshot references
2. Use these images as design guides for pixel-perfect implementation
3. Ensure the UI matches the visual design shown in these images

The app is designed to match the layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy shown in these reference images.
